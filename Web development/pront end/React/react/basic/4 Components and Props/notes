Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.

Components come in two types, 
	1. Class base components and
	2. Functional components
	
	
When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter
